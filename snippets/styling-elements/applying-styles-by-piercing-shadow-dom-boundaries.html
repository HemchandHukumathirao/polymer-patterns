# Applying styles by piercing Shadow DOM boundaries

Shows how to use the `::shadow` pseudo-element and the `/deep/` combinator
to pierce through the Shadow DOM boundaries of elements.

When you define styles in `<head>` for a Polymer element you are using,
those styles do not penetrate the element's shadow boundaries. For that, you
must use the `::shadow` pseudo-element or the `/deep/` combinator.
For example:

    <style>
      body /deep/ h2 {
        color: green;
      }
      my-element::shadow p {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>

The style definition using `/deep/` ignores *all* shadow boundaries for `<h2>`
elements. The style definition using `::shadow` pierces the shadow boundaries of
`<my-element>` to make all `<p>` elements in it red.

Assume you have the following HTML in the `<body>`:

    <my-element></my-element>
    <h2>Heading outside my-element</h2>

This generates the following composed tree:

    <h2>Heading inside my-element</h2>
    <p>Para inside my-element</p>
    <h2>Heading outside my-element</h2>

Using `/deep/` makes both `<h2> elements green, and using `::shadow` makes the
`<p>` element red.

[using `/deep/` and `::shadow` in your styles](http://www.polymer-project.org/articles/styling-elements.html#style-fromoutside).
