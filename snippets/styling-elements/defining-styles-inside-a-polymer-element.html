# Defining styles inside a Polymer element

Shows how to set the style poperties of a Polymer element from within the
element.

To style the internal markup of an element, include a `<link>` or
`<style>` tag inside the topmost `<template>`. Use `:host` to define styles
that apply to the element itself:

    <template>
      <style>
        :host {
          /* Note: by default elements are always display:inline. */
          display: block;
          color: blue;
        }
        p {
          color: red;
        }
      </style>
      ...
    </template>

If the snippet is invoked in this way:

    <my-element>
      <p>Distributed para</p>
    </my-element>
    <p>Para outside the element</p>

It generates the following composed tree:

    <h2>Blue heading</h2>
    <p>Red para inside element</p>
    <p>Distributed para</p>
    <p>Para outside the element</p>


- The `<h2>` inside `<my-element>` and the distributed para inserted through the
`<content>` tag get their blue color from the `color` definition in the
`:host` block.

- The `<p>` inside `<my-element>` gets its red color from the `color`
definition _outside_ the `:host` block.

- Since styles defined in an element scope to that element, the `<p>` outside
is unaffected by the styles defined within `<my-element>`.
